## Project Overview
This project is a [brief description, e.g., React web app, Node.js API, Python library].

## Build and Test Commands
- To build the project, run: `npm run build`
- To run tests, use: `npm test`
- To check code formatting, run: `npm run lint`

## Coding Style Guidelines
- Use 2-space indentation throughout
- Follow ES6+ JavaScript syntax (use `import/export` modules)
- Prefer single quotes for strings except in JSX (use double quotes)
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Write clear, concise comments explaining non-obvious logic

## Branching and Workflow
- Use feature branches off `main` for new features or bug fixes
- Create pull requests for code review before merging
- Run tests and lint checks before merging to `main`

## Common Libraries/Frameworks
- React 18 with hooks
- Express 4 for backend APIs
- Jest for testing

## Useful Commands for Claude
- "Add a new React component"
- "Fix the bug in userAuthentication.js"
- "Write a unit test for the new function"
- "Refactor the API route handler"

## Environment and Setup
- Node.js v18+
- Use `.env` for environment variables (do not commit this file)

## Notes
- Keep functions pure where possible
- Prioritize code clarity over cleverness
- Optimize for readability and maintainability
